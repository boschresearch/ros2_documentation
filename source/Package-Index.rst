Package Index
=============

The `ROS Index (index.ros.org) <https://index.ros.org/>`_ is a database of all packages that have been released on the build farm and are thus directly installable. For each package, the ROS Index provides a dedicated page [#]_ with version information, links, and documentation.

.. [#] *For developers:* The upper part of such a page contains common information taken from the ``package.xml``. Below, the ``README.md`` of your package source folder (which is not necessarily the root of your repository) is rendered. Use it for custom documentation. This supersedes ROS Wiki.
